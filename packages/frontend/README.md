# Online IDE `clavicode` frontend

## Build instructions

### Preparation

Install Node.js for build TypeScript sources. We suggest using `nvm` on *nix. See [nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

This is an Angular project. Install Angular CLI for next steps:

```
npm i -g @angular/cli
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

### Serve with hot reload

Run [backend](https://github.com/Guyutongxue/clavicode-backend) at `http://localhost:3000`. Then:

```
ng serve
```

### Build assets

```
ng build
```

Copy or link assets to backend. See backend repository for detail.
